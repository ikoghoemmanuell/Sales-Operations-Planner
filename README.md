## Description
I was asked to write a program that calculates the product quantity based on certain variables provided.

## How it Works
The program asks the user to enter the following data:

1. Stock level
2. The number of months
3. The planned sales quantity for each month

Based on this data, it gives us the production quantity as follows:

1. If the sales quantity is smaller than the stock level of the previous month, the production quantity is 0
2. Else, the production quantity is this difference
